## Interviewer:

Hello!

I have a check-in request: would it be OK for me to CC a friend on this?  I am trying to spin up other people in doing these interviews, and getting them context would be useful.  (If that makes you uncomfortable in any way, that is OK and they can stay out of it!)

As an opener, how about these questions?  (I'd like to include enough that things move quickly for you, but not so many that it's overwhelming/asking followup questions is unnatural.)

As a note, please feel free to not answer anything you choose.  For example, some respondents weren't comfortable including the state they were from.

1. How is your day going?

2. What is your first name, and where are you from?

3. When did you first start supporting the Trump campaign/administration?

4. What were your top 3 issues going into the election?

5. What do you wish people understood better about your politics?

## Respondent:


My day is just fine nothing is on fire

I am Ben and I live in North Carolina

I voted for Trump in the primaries and my mind was really made up once it was pretty clear the choices were Ted Cruz or Donald Trump.

My top issues were Gun rights, Migration and i don't know how to sum up the lat one but just a general fear of socialism. seeing things like the DNC talking about a $15 minimum wage and people like   Sanders getting support while openly saying he is a socialist.

I wish people understood that just because I think other people have the right to be a jerk doesn't mean I support their view. I think it is crazy that you can force someone to sell someone something and it only makes people bitter and slows down progress.

## Interviewer:

Good to meet you Ben!  (My name is also Ben.)  I am glad to hear you are doing well, and thank you very much for your responses.

A couple followup questions:

Gun rights have been an interesting theme in my experience with these interviews; I have been iffy on the Dem approach to gun rights questions for some time, and am leaning toward "just abandon this issue and focus on other things."  It's super divisive, and many people agitating for more controls don't actually know much about guns.  (For example, that assault weapons ban is sure going to be useful when most gun deaths come from handguns!)  If Dems just punted and you could push for whatever gun control laws you wanted, would you push for any?  If so, which ones?

Could you say more about the general fear of socialism?  I confess that there are a couple sectors of the economy where I would like things more regulated and made cheaply available to everyone.  (For example, I think Internet is a basic human need in the modern US, and would prefer it be as ubiquitous and cheap as telephone or water service.  I also just don't like Comcast :P .)  What are some socialist-leaning regulations you are particularly concerned/not concerned with, in addition to the minimum wage?

And a few more from the general set:

What do people think about your politics that just isn’t true?

What are you most excited about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

What are you most worried about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

## Respondent:

What gun control laws would I push for?  None! The nfa still exist ,the gca of1968 still  exist, NICS is broken, the Hughes amendment still exist, states still ignore the 2nd amendment whenever they feel like it and the ATF ignores court decisions and does whatever the hell it wants.  I'll start thinking about a way to reasonably regulate firearms after all that is fixed.

The state should handle major public infrastructure and nothing else.  We need to break up monopolies in utilities not hand them to the government. Google Fiber came to my town and magically everyone else start offering gigabit internet dirt cheap. I am really skeptical of socialized medicine because I have seen how awful the VA is.

People assume I'm some racist gay hating transphobic asshat beacuse I'm way more pro freedom from than i am freedom too. I'm heavily involved in the bdsm community around me and live in a black city, I'm sure I hang out with all the gay, trans and black people beacuse I hate them.

Trump was endorsed by the NRA in the primaries and just spoke at the NRA convention as the potus. He campaign promising National CCW or reproceity, that's a huge deal.  So that's what I'm looking forward too.

My biggest worry is moderate republicans getting in the way of completely killing Obamacare and bitching out on pushing progun laws.

If this gets used in any way I'm curious to see it

## Interviewer:

Oh certainly, I will only use it if you sign off first :) .  Sorry for the delay on my end; I feel rather ill and couldn't respond coherently.  I hope your week is going better!

Those answers make sense to me.  On healthcare, how do you feel about the AHCA?  What do you want a replacement to Obamacare to look like?

Finally, these are the last questions from the general set.  Afterwards I can paste everything together as a transcript and run it by you!

Where do you get your news?

I am a relatively liberal person, though I was annoyed at the Clinton campaign. What is a policy you think you and I can agree on?

What is a policy you would like to believe we could agree on, but don’t know that we would?

## Respondent:


As far as Healthcare I would love to see a return to the laws pre Obamacare and nothing else.

I drive a lot everyday and I tend to here about most things on the radio.  If I'm wanting to here about how the Democrats are falling apart  and trump is getting his way on everything, I'll listen to npr. If i want to here about how the republicans can't manage to break out of a paper bag, I'll listen to conservative talk radio.

We can probably agree on nothing.  I used to think i had a lot of overlap with liberals beacuse I'm pretty anti religion but now the lefts bizarre love for islam has thrown a wrench in that.

I really don't think we're going to have any overlap
