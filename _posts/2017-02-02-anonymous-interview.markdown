An interviewee found through the internet wished to remain anonymous.  Here are his/her responses!

### Q: When did you first start supporting the Trump campaign/administration?


Early in the primaries. I disliked Trump prior to that but when I saw how he was calling people out left and right that changed my opinion on him. Still see him as a shit talker, but an honest one in the grand scheme of things, and somebody who knows how to win even if that means self promoting.

### Q: What were your top 3 issues going into the election?

Civil liberties (in particular domestic spying), balanced budget and ACA repeal. Foreign relations w/ Russia probably tied with the latter two but hard to say that far retrospect.

### Q: What do you wish people understood better about your politics?

I like Trump but you don't have to. He can still be a means to an end if people look behind the things they dislike about him.

### Q: What do people think about your politics that just isn't true?

That I'm racist or ignorant.

### Q: What are you most worried about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

That he'll be sidelined by the republicans.

### Q: Where do you get your news?

I get most analysis from people who are either totally outside the media bubble or at the edges of it. Raw news coverage from whatever is covering it the fastest, usually if I'm looking for breaking coverage I've got multiple streams going at once.

### Q: What are you tired of hearing?

Apocalyptic stuff.

### Q: I am a relatively liberal person, though I was annoyed at the Clinton campaign. What is a policy you think you and I can agree on?

The ultra wealthy are out of control.

### Q: What is a policy you would like to believe we could agree on, but don't know that we would?

That we can roll back neoliberalism (global pansociety with a universal set of values) without turning the US into a dictatorship, and keep the US on top at the same time.
