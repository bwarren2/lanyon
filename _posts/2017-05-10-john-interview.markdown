## Interviewer:

Hello!

I have a check-in request: would it be OK for me to CC a friend on this?  I am trying to spin up other people in doing these interviews, and getting them context would be useful.  (If that makes you uncomfortable in any way, that is OK and they can stay out of it!)

As an opener, how about these questions?  (I'd like to include enough that things move quickly for you, but not so many that it's overwhelming/asking followup questions is unnatural.)

As a note, please feel free to not answer anything you choose.  For example, some respondents weren't comfortable including the state they were from.

1. How is your day going?

2. What is your first name, and where are you from?

3. When did you first start supporting the Trump campaign/administration?

4. What were your top 3 issues going into the election?

5. What do you wish people understood better about your politics?

## Respondent:

Hi Ben,



Sure, feel free to CC a friend.



1. How is your day going?

It’s going pretty well, honestly.  Just got done with a series of end-of-school-year meetings, and can relax for a little while before final exams.

	2. What is your first name, and where are you from?

My name is John, and I’m from Indiana.

	3. When did you first start supporting the Trump campaign/administration?

I jumped on the Trump Train in mid-February of 2016, after the February 6(?) debate when Marco Rubio did his robot impersonation.  I was a Rubio supporter, albeit not a strong supporter, because I liked his overall demeanor and his conservativism on most issues I cared about.  After he massively screwed up at that debate, I realized that he just did not have the experience and support to succeed against an establishment candidate like Hillary, who was obviously going to beat Bernie and get the nomination.  I decided that of the remaining candidates, I didn’t like Ted Cruz’s smarmy mannerisms and couldn’t see him being successful in a full-fledged campaign because of his niche campaign agendas, thought John Kasich was too center-left for a Republican and was disappointed by his debate presence, and decided that Trump, given his surprising performances at debates and in the polls, had a chance at being the next president.  I was also reading Scott Adams’ (the Dilbert cartoonist) blog posts and saw that Adams had a lot right about how Trump had gotten as far as he did, and thought Adams was right that Trump had the best chance of winning the nomination and then the presidency.

	4. What were your top 3 issues going into the election?

First: religious freedom/constitutionalism.  I had no confidence that Hillary would uphold the Constitution as it stands, particularly the 1st and 2nd Amendments, and have been increasingly worried by the prevalence of progressive agendas in politics.  Hillary would further all the progressive agendas without a doubt, including making the Supreme Court leftist and biased against conservatives.

Second: immigration/national security.  Trump was the only candidate to make it clear that illegal immigration and excessive refugee admittance would be unacceptable.  Clinton went the opposite direction on illegal aliens and essentially said that open borders were her goal.  That’s unacceptable to me and completely against the rule of law.  Trump also made it clear that we would not be importing potential terrorists, which I appreciated very much.

Third: abortion.  I’m very pro-life. Abortion is killing a baby, pure and simple.  I’m not some hick who doesn’t understand science, I’ve based my beliefs about abortion on scientific observations about human life.  Trump is pro-life with the same exceptions as I have.  Clinton was pro-abortion to the point of promoting partial-birth abortion (a practice the left likes to deny the existence of), and I couldn’t stand her despicable indifference to the life of the baby.

	5. What do you wish people understood better about your politics?

This is actually kind of a tough one.  There are some obvious answers, like: I’m not a racist, I just want people to follow the law; I’m not a sociopath who hates poor people and doesn’t want to give them insurance, I just want my money to be used for me, not the rest of the country; etc.

The biggest thing I think leftists need to understand about conservatives is this: we don’t hate lgbtq people/Muslims/”brown people”/poor people, or want to take away their right to live. We want to live our own lives, without being forced to pay for other people’s lives, forced to do things for other people we don’t want to, forced to take worse jobs because of diversity quotas, forced to cater to other religions, etc.  I am fine with gay marriage being a legal thing. I just don’t want to be forced to agree with it. I’m fine with “brown people” living around me.  I just don’t want to be forced to pay for their existence if they’re refugees, in rundown neighborhoods, etc.  Leftists seem to want to force me to agree to everything in the liberal agenda, or be ostracized. That’s ridiculous and anti-American.

Does that make sense so far?

John

## Interviewer:

Hi John!  (I am Ben from DC, btw.)  It's good to hear things are going well for you :) .  (Apologies for the delay on my end; I am at a family reunion, and sneaking these in where I can.)  Thank you for your well-laid-out responses, they definitely make sense so far!

A couple followup questions:

What are the top two or three issues on the progressive agendas/constitutionalism that bother you?  That don't bother you?  I know that gun control policies have been a recurring point in these interviews, and personally I am leaning toward "Dems should just punt on gun control"; it's an incredibly divisive issue, there is little consensus on what progress looks like, and unfortunately many gun control advocates are a bit too ignorant.  (For example, that assault weapons ban is definitely going to be relevant while most gun deaths come from handguns!)  I don't personally own guns, but my cousin the army is an aficionado, and I wish our national conversations on guns could be as healthy as the ones I have with him.

On abortion, can I get your perspective a question I ask lots of people? How do you feel about spermicidal IUDs?  Personally, I don't like to dance too closely to the line of "is this murder?" in practice, so I would be a huge fan of minimizing the number of cases that get to that point, and increasing contraception availability seems to do that.  I mathed it out once, and it would come out to ~$4/person/mo, which I would be fine just adding to my tax bill.  What is your preferred policy approach?

More questions from the standard set:

What do people think about your politics that just isn’t true?

What are you most excited about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

What are you most worried about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?


## Respondent:

Ben –



I’ll do the same copy-paste thing I did before… I also have a crazy weekend so my replies will be delayed.



    What are the top two or three issues on the progressive agendas/constitutionalism that bother you?

Currently the things about progressivism that worry me most are: attacks on free speech (see: Antifa, Berkeley riots, women’s march kicking out pro-life groups), massive push to normalize what scientists and doctors define as mental disorders (transgenderism, identifying as ???gender, pushing children to become transgender), and refusal to confront Islam as against liberal, tolerant values (anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-free speech, etc.).  That list is prioritized :). If groups like Antifa didn’t exist, the 2nd item would be a bigger issue to me, but the assault on conservative ideas by the alt-left is increasingly worrisome.

    That don't bother you?

This is actually a really good question.  I had to think about this for a bit. Would say the top 3 things that don’t worry me about progressivism are: interest in protecting refugees (with the qualifier that this should mean all refugees, not just young muslim children from Syria), abnormal fascination with Russia (it’s gonna come to nothing and will make them look bad in the end), and pushing farther to the left on socialism (socialism doesn’t work, is regularly proven to not work, and America will never become socialist, so this is not gonna be a problem later).

    I know that gun control policies have been a recurring point in these interviews, and personally I am leaning toward "Dems should just punt on gun control"; it's an incredibly divisive issue, there is little consensus on what progress looks like, and unfortunately many gun control advocates are a bit too ignorant.  (For example, that assault weapons ban is definitely going to be relevant while most gun deaths come from handguns!)  I don't personally own guns, but my cousin the army is an aficionado, and I wish our national conversations on guns could be as healthy as the ones I have with him.

Happy to see that you haven’t fallen for the Democrat lie that banning assault weapons will do anything. It’s a hazy, weird thing they like pushing because “assault weapons” sounds scary, but it’s not backed up by data.  I don’t personally own a gun nor do I feel a need to, but if I lived in a more dangerous area I absolutely would buy one and get training. It’s meaningful to me that as US citizens, we are allowed to defend ourselves in an effective way, and I don’t want to limit or remove that right, which democrats want to do for the sake of politics.  I’m totally in favor of background checks for guns, which are in place, and even a (short) waiting period if necessary.  It’s not like I’m planning to do anything with my gun that’s illegal…

	On abortion, can I get your perspective a question I ask lots of people? How do you feel about spermicidal IUDs?

I mathed it out once, and it would come out to ~$4/person/mo, which I would be fine just adding to my tax bill.  What is your preferred policy approach?

I’m fine with contraceptives. My issue comes when someone removes a fetus from a uterus.  Sperm aren’t going to become humans on their own. Same with eggs. It’s what happens when sperm and egg come together and work properly.  However, and this is big, I refuse to pay for someone else’s birth control. Having sex is a choice, not a necessity. I don’t go around having sex with people (don’t want kids right now, don’t want STDs ever, don’t trust condoms or people, and am not married). If someone else chooses to go around having sex indiscriminately, I’m not going to support that habit.  It’s like if you were asked to pay for drugs for someone’s drug habit.  It’s a stupid idea (no offense) to have to pay for something which is used for an avoidable circumstance.  It’s not like I’m refusing to pay for HIV meds.  Nobody is going to die if they don’t have sex while not on birth control.

	More questions from the standard set:

	What do people think about your politics that just isn’t true?

Hmm… I don’t unconditionally support everything Republicans do, or Trump does.  They’re dead wrong on net neutrality, for example. The Ryancare plan was garbage. But I agree with most of what they have to say.  I’m also not going to bend over backward to defend anything Trump says/does.  I never defended his taped blunders (the Billy Bush incident), and I don’t feel the need to defend how he talks sometimes (disorganized).

	What are you most excited about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

We’re finally respecting our laws and looking to defend ourselves from outside influences.  Immigration is being regulated the way it is legislated.  Trade is being negotiated as pro-US, not to support other countries.  The UN is doing stupid stuff (see: Haiti), and we’re calling them out on it. Allies are being treated right (Egypt, Israel) and enemies are being told where to step off (North Korea, Syria).  I’m looking forward to more law being used and less feely liberal policies being implemented, along with good Supreme Court appointments!

	What are you most worried about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

I don’t want him to start going toward globalism like it seems establishment republicans are trying to do (McCain, Lindsey Graham, Ryan).  I think he’s doing a good job of resisting influences like that, but don’t know for sure.  Also don’t really want issues like democrats screaming Russia and travel expenses and Flynn and emoluments to continue.  They’re distractions, and need to be solved conclusively so we can move on.

This is kinda fun… and I’m guessing you don’t get a lot of longer well-written responses (if I may stroke my own ego a bit).

John

## Interviewer:

These are definitely well-laid-out responses John, thank you!  (Apologies for the delay on my end; I have been rather ill.  I hope your week is going better!)

I am 100% with you on Net Neutrality.  As a software developer, I am invested in the internet not being dominated by a few big companies, and as a citizen I want a level playing field for new and interesting business.  I am not clear on why people would be against :/ .  On Obamacare/Ryancare, do you have a preferred outcome?  (As far as I can tell, we either go toward universal healthcare and subsidize somehow, or get rid of treating everyone that walks into an emergency room.  (Otherwise, we just have the most expensive form of universal healthcare.)

On guns, I wish more people had familiarity with 1) what the current laws are, 2) with what changes are actually effective.  Are the effective proposals, that are not yet implemented, that most gun owners support?  Who knows, because we are too busy shouting past eachother!

Thank you for responding so thoroughly and in detail, I really appreciate it!  I wish all my interviews made this so easy :)

Here are the last few questions from the standard set.  After these, I can stitch together a transcript and run it by you (if you are comfortable with me posting.  Otherwise, no worries!)

Where do you get your news?

I am a relatively liberal person, though I was annoyed at the Clinton campaign. What is a policy you think you and I can agree on?

What is a policy you would like to believe we could agree on, but don’t know that we would?

Have a great day!

## Respondent:

Ben –

This is finals week at my college, but I imagine it’s still going better than yours!  Almost done though – I’m a graduating senior.

	I am 100% with you on Net Neutrality.  As a software developer, I am invested in the internet not being dominated by a few big companies, and as a citizen I want a level playing field for new and interesting business.  I am not clear on why people would be against :/ .

I’m going into IT and probably will be doing some software dev in the future, so I’m in the same boat. I’d say that’s the only thing about the Republican party right now that makes me regret having to support them for all the other policies I agree on.

	On Obamacare/Ryancare, do you have a preferred outcome?  (As far as I can tell, we either go toward universal healthcare and subsidize somehow, or get rid of treating everyone that walks into an emergency room.  Otherwise, we just have the most expensive form of universal healthcare.)

I find the idea of universal healthcare for a nation as big as the US to be absurd.  There’s too many people who wouldn’t be paying enough into the system for it to be realistically self-supporting.  I think Obamacare was a terrible plan based on how it was advertised, then implemented (so many lies along the way), and how much it increased costs for many Americans.  Ryancare seems to be a neutered Obamacare with most of the problems that came with it, so I’m not a fan of that either.  I’d prefer the Trumpian approach of removing regulations from insurance companies such as being able to compete nationally rather than locally, while still leaving a few of the regulations on pre-existing conditions.  I wouldn’t force all insurance companies to follow the pre-existing condition rules under Obamacare though, perhaps only apply those rules to companies who have greater than X revenue a year.  I haven’t thought through that idea very well, it literally just came into my head…

	On guns, I wish more people had familiarity with 1) what the current laws are, 2) with what changes are actually effective.  Are the effective proposals, that are not yet implemented, that most gun owners support?  Who knows, because we are too busy shouting past eachother!

IMO, gun critics are so loudly opposed to guns because they have NO IDEA what guns can and cannot do.  If people actually understood what guns were, we’d have fewer issues.  That, and the media really likes burying every incident stopped by a person carrying legally, and blows up anything, accident or attack, that involves “assault rifle” style guns, however nebulous that concept is.  We just need more education.

	Thank you for responding so thoroughly and in detail, I really appreciate it!  I wish all my interviews made this so easy :)

You’re very welcome :) I used to try to do stuff like this on Reddit (back before /r/politics became a cesspool of astroturfed shareblue and salon articles), but I’ve given up on trying to get people in the more rabid anti-Trump circles to see reason.

	Here are the last few questions from the standard set.  After these, I can stitch together a transcript and run it by you (if you are comfortable with me posting.  Otherwise, no worries!)

Sounds good.

	Where do you get your news?

Lots of places. I watch Fox and MSNBC sometimes (those 2 channels seem to be aware of their biases, unlike CNN), read FiveThirtyEight, NYT, WaPo, The Federalist, Breitbart (read some of their stuff, seriously – you’ll find it’s clearly biased but not off-the-wall crazy like some leftist news sites), whatever sites The_Donald and /r/worldnews share on Reddit (got banned from /r/news way back when for going against their biases so I don’t subscribe there anymore), anything linked by people I follow Twitter, and more stuff I can’t think of off the top of my head.  I try not to live in the right-wing bubble too much, but the left-wing bubble is so toxic to a conservative like me that I really can’t stay there long.

	I am a relatively liberal person, though I was annoyed at the Clinton campaign. What is a policy you think you and I can agree on?

Damn good question.  Net Neutrality is low-hanging fruit… I think that limiting politicians’ terms would be good.  We have too many people in Congress/Senate right now who are dictating where this country goes, but have been professional politicians so long that they have no idea what real people think.  I’m looking at you, Pelosi, Feinstein, Schumer, Cummings, McConnell, Hatch, Cochran, Grassley, Conyers, Leahy… There’s a lot of high-ranking Democrats in that list, which is interesting, isn’t it?

	What is a policy you would like to believe we could agree on, but don’t know that we would?

Also very good question.  I would say one policy that I can’t believe people don’t agree on is banning “sanctuary cities”.  By that, I mean cities that actively refuse to turn over illegal aliens caught committing crimes to ICE.  It seems obvious. Person who shouldn’t be here to begin with violates a law significant enough to warrant being arrested by the police?  Just turn him/her over to ICE and let them take care of it.  Some cities in the US will just release an illegal alien because the city’s leadership don’t want deportations happening in the city.  I’ll be honest, I don’t really care about illegal aliens just existing, paying taxes, working toward citizenship.  I start caring when illegals start protesting our laws or committing crimes.  The law is the law.  I can protest the fact that I’ll get jailed for stealing a car, but that doesn’t change the law.  Same with immigration. Accept that you’re doing something wrong and work to fix it.  But I don’t know if you like the idea of sanctuary cities… and honestly, the concept makes so little sense to me that I can’t actually imagine why people support it.  It’s not like abortion.  I understand why people think it’s ok, but it’s murder to me.  Or gay marriage. Against being involved in it, but not my personal problem if I’m not involved.  Sanctuary cities, I just don’t get.  Hope that makes some level of sense.

John

## Interviewer:


John-

Thank you so, so much for your in-depth responses.  (And apologies for delays on my end; work has been rough.  I was up until 3AM yesterday.)  I have found these interviews really interesting for lots of reasons, but the details and commonalities are fascinating to me; you're not the first or second respondent to mention Net Neutrality, for example, and when we start making categories (like illegal immigrants that have been paying their taxes,) there is a lot more agreement than I or my friends had expected.
