## Interviewer:

Hello!

Thank you so much for following up/being patient with me during the process; there are a good number of these happening at once, and I am at a family reunion this weekend (so sneaking time here and there.)  I have a check-in request: would it be OK for me to CC a friend on this?  I am trying to spin up other people in doing these interviews, and getting them context would be useful.  (If that makes you uncomfortable in any way, that is OK and they can stay out of it!)

As an opener, how about these questions?  (I'd like to include enough that things move quickly for you, but not so many that it's overwhelming/asking followup questions is unnatural.)  As a note, please feel free to not answer anything you choose.  For example, some respondents weren't comfortable including the state they were from.

1. How is your day going?

2. What is your first name, and where are you from?

3. When did you first start supporting the Trump campaign/administration?

4. What were your top 3 issues going into the election?

5. What do you wish people understood better about your politics?
 .

## Respondent:

Hello,  I'm okay with that.  If i do take longer to respond I apologize, My weekdays are usually pretty busy. I'll answer the questions by number.

1.   My day is going pretty good, it's a little chilly and cloudy out but I cannot complain. Hope the family reunion is going well for you.

2.  I'm Adam and I'm from NYS

3.  This will be a little lengthy. I ultimately didn't make the decision to vote for Trump until I was in the voting booth looking at the screen going "F*****ng really America?"... I had followed his campaign closely since sometime in 2015, and I had reservations about voting for him. I think the thing that stood out to me and made me sway twords casting a vote to him was the way he talked about America and it's people.  When he says he loves america I feel he's being sincere and something about that resonates with me.

4. I'm pretty moderate politically so I don't get overly worked up over the issues.   but if I had to name three id say gun rights, healthcare and National security. I'll explain further... I'm fully aware that guns will never be completely outlawed in america, and I actually support stricter background checks and regulations that nature, but I do have concerns that it could lead to over regulation. Healthcare is another thing I care about, Alot of peopl(including myself) have seen an increase in premiums, I do think healthcare is something that should be accessible to all and I feel that ACA was good in the short term, but we need something that will stand on its own and not be something that's half goverment,Half free market... thats how we end up with outrageous premiums.  And lastly national security, I think we've done a good job at keeping ourselves safe from attack, we arent attacked on a regular basis like europe and I hope we can continue to strengthen out security, while still allowing people to enter.

5. I have a few things I'd like to say about this. First would be this, Neither party is trying to harm America... They're both trying to achieve the same goal by using different approaches.... Second thing is ...be careful who you follow politically.  I've seen a rise in popularity of Facebook pages and speakers who carry a "loath the other side" mentality.. I.E.  occupy democrats, milo yiannopoulos and so on.. That doesn't help us grow as a country and does nothing to close the gap.  and lastly, politics isn't a team sport..  we should all stand up for our own morals, not let something slide because it's our party doing the thing we disagree with.

## Interviewer:


Hey Adam!

Apologies for the delay on my end circling back to this.  I have been a bit overwhelmed with travel and work and an illness, and I am only just catching up.  If you are fine proceeding with the rest of the questions, I am still keen to hear what you think!  (And should be faster going forward.)

One thing I love about doing these interviews is how much shared sentiment 	crops up.  I also had the "F*****ng really America?" response, think that liberals don't understand guns well enough to come up with good policy, and lament the rise of the "loathe the other side" factions.  (One of the intentions of this project is to get data to break people out of their little echo-chambers of feelings.  I have a couple friends who think "all Trump voters" are the same "racist", and I love to disabuse them of that notion.)

I have a few more of the general-sample questions for you:

What do people think about your politics that just isn’t true?

What are you most worried about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

What are you most excited about in the Trump administration over the next 4 years?

Either way, I hope you are having a great day!

Best,
Ben

## Respondent:

Hi Ben,

Sorry it's taken a few days to get back to you, It's been a busy week.  I hope all is well with you.

What do people think about my politics that just isn’t true?... Well I'm pretty moderate politically, I lean slightly right on a few issues.  I think the biggest misconception is that im not open to debate or changes in the law. Take immagration for example,I think the immagration laws should be enforced,But I'm certainly open to changing the law. I'm just a firm believer that while it is law, it needs to be enforced.

The next two questions ill sort of answer at the same time, I have plenty of concerns about the events that could occur over the next 4 years. This election really did split the country and regaurdless of outcome, it was going to upset a large portion of the population. My biggest concern is our current inability to compromise taking over and becoming something that is just buisness as usual. Republicans shouldn't be applauding the way the GOP is just shutting the democrats out of everything in the house right now, and the democrats shouldn't be excited about the idea they'll be getting to do the same thing someday. Two party political systems arent supposed to be about a tug of war where no progress is made. It's supposed to be about debate and compromise in an attempt to govern the 320 million people who currently live in  the US. If your party wins the majority and the white house and your first thought is " good, Now we can demolish everything the other side built up for the last 8 years", your heart is in the wrong place.

That being said I do think that once everything cools down, I do think we will see people stepping up and agreeing to actually talk and work out things in a manner that is satisfactory for both sides. The United States has triumphed over tough times before, I have faith we will get past this.

Hope you're well,
Adam.

## Interviewer:

Thank you Adam!  I 100% agree with you on several things, it turns out.  To me, the political tug of war seems not only unAmerican, but also a substantive national security risk; we can't spend all day every day running in place, because the other countries of the world (looking at you, China) are going to keep making steady progress until they surpass us.  What do you think could motivate people to step up and talk things out in a satisfactory way?  My little pipe dream is to get voters to talk to other voters, but it is slow going.

More questions from the general set:

Where do you get your news?

What are you tired of hearing?

I am a relatively liberal person, though I was annoyed at the Clinton campaign. What is a policy you think you and I can agree on?

What is a policy you would like to believe we could agree on, but don’t know that we would?

I hope you are also having a great day!


## Respondent:

Hope all is well Ben,

Personally i think in order to actually move towards an effective dialogue, We need to actually get people who usually don't care about political issues to become involved.  A majority of Americans don't really care what happens and just sort of show up to the ballots and vote on party lines ( if they vote at all).  Political debate without an actual audience is just a stalemate.  Realistically a debate is for those in the audience who are on the fence, Not those who have a solidified belief. Example: Sally Kohn and Ben Shapiro debating at politi-con aren't debating to change the other persons mind, They're debating to persuade the audience into their belief. Which is why you see an uptick in the "loath the other side mentality"...It works and it's easier than making an arguement...because really.. who wants to share beliefs with a racist?

But onto the general questions, When it comes to news, I actually read CNN,Fox News, The NY times and most of the other Mainstream media outlets.

As for things I'm sick of hearing? I'm really tired of "anonymous sources".. They always build up this big breakthrough, That's either false or just kind of fades away into nothing.. If Trump broke the law, colluded with russia or anything like that.. then I'll be one of the first to call for his arrest and impeachment...But they don't need to cloud the air with smoke.. let the investigation continue and let the cards fall where they will.

I think we can agree on climate change, I do see it as a major problem ( i did catch some flak on ATS for stating I wondered if people were willing to make the nessacary changes and that if china didn't slow its role on pollution then our changes wouldn't stop it destroying the planet).. But i absolutely agree climate change is a major threat to us.

And lastly I think we could agree the goverment over reaches sometimes, especially when it comes to permits and things like that. Example:  NYS fertilizer application license, You have to pay for courses and permits and it can becomes costly. I'm okay with the regulations, lawn Fertlizer isn't something to play with, and phosphorous is harmful for the water, But come on.. A couple grand every few years to maintain the liscense,   Samething with pistol permits... The police know immediately when they pull someone over if they have auto insurance.. but they can't keep track of a pistol permit?

## Interviewer:

That makes lots of sense, Adam.  Some friends and I are experimenting with ways to get people to talk about values and problems, instead of judging group membership.  (Our next idea on the docket: hosting a dinner with mixed ideologies and an explicit "let's be better" intention.)  It's really frustrating when people just check out of level-headed reasoning and vote their identity; where are we supposed to go from there?

You're also definitely right that the press is a huge problem.  I feel like the media lost a ton of revenue from classifieds to craigslist and never really figured out how to be profitable without stirring up controversy.  What do you think three good proposals on climate change are?  Personally, I feel like "renewable energy is national priority" should be uncontroversial, (so we stop paying money to Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 terrorists came from.) but it always seems more contentious.

I don't have any more questions from the general set, other than the publication one.  I've found this discussion really useful, and would like to share it on my site to show people how cross-aisle conversations can be really healthy and good.  If I stitched together a transcript merging the emails, would you be OK with me posting that?  (I'd run the final copy by you just to be sure it looked right.)

Either way is fine!  I really appreciate you taking the time and being so reasonable.  I hope you are having a great Tuesday!
