title: Thanksgiving Antivenom
---

There has not been a single healthy conversation about politics in my family in living memory.  That is, until this Thanksgiving.  Here's what changed, how I made it happen, and how you can do it at home.

The short version:

 1. Don't argue solutions; solicit perspectives
 2. Find common problems
 3. De-escalate as needed.

## Background

Most of the time, my family cannot resist talking about politics at the holiday dinner table, and things quickly devolve to ranting (bordering on shouting).  Almost all of them are Fox News-watching Republicans, ie primed for the "heads almost shouting at eachother" mode of political discourse.

## Methods

This year the favored issue was school vouchers: "personal choice is important" and "charters are so efficient" and "teachers unions are terrible".  Trying to engage arguments was not productive; it quickly devolved into the "bickering heads" communications patterns, like an argumentative tug of war.

However, one thing made an enormous change: I opted out of the conflict model.  I asked the table sincerely: "What were everyone's top 3 issues last election?  I want to know."  Rather than try to tug harder on the argumentation rope, I let go entirely and sought to considerately hear people.

## Results

The difference was like night and day.  The venom and urge to interrupt vanished from the room; given the floor and an audience seeking to understand, there was nothing to fight over.  Everyone was instantly much more pensive and considerate, and we even managed to find some common causes.  The "bickering heads" model of Fox News has no pattern for a sympathetic listener, so the spell was broken.

The data sample (bottom) includes what people's particular issues were, but the big ones were:

 * School choice (voucher)
 * Supreme Court appointees
 * Deference to state/individual preference

## Analysis

### TL;DR:

If you take only one thing away from this piece, let it be temporarily ceding conversational struggles.  (You can always fight later if you want to!)

When both sides are rhetorically wrestling the other into submission, it is easy for both sides to get lost in the context.  There's an easy way out: just sympathetically ask a framing question and listen for a bit.  Fox News can't use this pattern because it isn't dramatic, but you can!

### Common Cause

Once a healthy sharing had started, it was easier to split controversial proposals into more-agreeable pieces.  Struggling over "vouchers, yes/no?" locked up the conversation; but earnest "why's" stripped off the talking points concealing tractable discourse.  "Vouchers are important" became "I feel like our school system is not working because we spend in the top half for results in the bottom half", which is a pretty understandable position!  Once a common interest in good education was established, it was possible to postulate experiments or changes to get better outcomes.  Suddenly, everyone was on the same side.

### De-escalation

There was one instance where the comfortable ranty-patterns came back.  When Theo started to get into a groove of complaining about liberals, a reframing instantly changed things: "Theo, I understand what I want from you: I want to understand what you think.  I don't understand what you want from me right now".  Momentarily stunned, Theo removed himself for a few minutes, refreshed his drink, and came back thoroughly civil.

## Data Sample

Here are the issues people focused on:

### Wife A, "Claire"

#### Left behind

Claire feels like big groups of people are being left behind, and the focus is only on a few small groups (like gay and trans people).

#### Respect for beliefs

Claire thinks the US was founded as a religious country, and we should not trample people's sincerely held religions beliefs (ex on gay marriage).

#### Ethnic Pride

"What is wrong with being proud of being Italian, or Irish, or ..."  (This contrasted with husband B: "proud of being an American.")

#### School vouchers

"Why shouldn't people be allowed to choose which school they go to?  How could that choice be bad?"

### Husband A, "Theo"

#### Tax Reform

Theo wants the tax code Dramatically simplifies; remove carried interest deduction, mortgage deduction, etc.  Would keep the charitable deduction.

#### Education Reform

Theo wants to give african americans/minorities in cities a way out of failing schools with vouchers. Teachers' unions primarily exploit the new hires to benefit the oldsters.  Oregon has low graduation rates and high expenses.

#### Debt + Deficit

"Don't fund ongoing operations with a deficit.  Borrowing is for financing long term expenditures."

#### (Unexpected)

"Tired of name calling", "I not a homophobe just because I don't think gay people should be allowed to get married", "I have a gay stylist and he is great".

Theo thinks Trump is not actually a great businessman; he has mostly been leveraging his brand.

Has very strong feelings about employers getting to deduct health insurance expense from dollar 0, asymmetry with self-employed deductions (if any).

### Wife B, "Megan"

#### Schools + Teacher's Unions

"Lots of young people want to teach, but unions get in the way.  Teach For America is a great program.  Get the government out of education."

#### States' Rights

"States should decide" most things, including ed requirements and abortion restrictions.

#### Unexpected

"Roe v Wade is settled law."  Favors giving away birth control pills.  But, wants abortion to cost money as a disincentive.  Really doesn't like late term abortion.

### Husband B, "Henry"

#### Supreme Court

Henry thinks Far and away most important.  Delaying confirmation in "the last year" of a "lame duck presidency" is fine.  Senate's role is to consent and advise, and they can choose not to.  Garland believed to be too liberal.  Hillary's appointments would have changed the court for too long a time.

#### Debt + Deficit

"Don't fund ongoing operations with a deficit."

#### Misc

"If teachers are not happy with the pay, why do they go into it?"

#### (Unexpected)

Henry is mostly OK with pro-choice, but is familiar with data saying some women were getting 3-4 abortions per year in his state, aka abortion-as-contraception.
