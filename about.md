<p>It feels like civic discourse has broken down.
</p>
<p>This project is about outreach, and 1:1 connections that reach past the partisans.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>
	We reach out to strangers and solicit their perspectives.  Our methodology is straightforward:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<strong>First Contact</strong>: Getting people to talk to.  Currently we find likely candidates on Reddit and direct message them personally asking for an interview.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Scheduling the interview</strong>:  We juggle the conversation from there to assuage concerns and put a timeslot on the calendar.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Interviewing</strong>: Via Skype or Hangouts, we ask questions off the list and produce notes to reflect the conversation.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Getting Signoff</strong>: We run the finished notes by the interviewee to make sure their thoughts are accurately reflected. <em>Unless we get explicit signoff from the interviewee, we don't post anything.</em>  We want everyone to feel good about our work.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Posting</strong>: We post finished interviews on this site.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>
	We are a few Americans concerned about declining capacity for people to just talk.  Currently, there are ~4 of us with varying levels of involvement based on schedule.  Some of us lean left, some of us were deeply annoyed at the Clinton campaign, all of us want to bridge the communication gap.
